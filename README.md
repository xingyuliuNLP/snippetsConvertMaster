## Why

Although there are tons of online snippet converters, they can only convert ONE snippet at one time, which is annoying when you have lots of snippets to convert.

Now you could use our snippetsConvertMaster to convert all your snippets at once used in Vsc, Sublime Text and Atom.

## How to use
Download [snippetsMasterV4.py](https://github.com/xingyuliuNLP/snippetsConvertMaster/blob/master/snippetsMasterV4.py)

### Create a snippet text file and convert it for Vsc/Atom/Sublime Text
1. Write your input text file according to the following rules

	You could put all of your snippets in this input file and convert them all to the output file.

	There is an example file in [exampleInput folder](https://github.com/xingyuliuNLP/snippetsConvertMaster/blob/master/exampleInput/snippetsPraat.txt)

	* Every snippet begins with a hash sign and a space <kbd>#&nbsp;</kbd>
	* Description: append snippet's description just after the hash sign and space in the same line
	* Prefix: append snippet's prefix at the next line of description
	* Body: append snippet's main content from the next line of prefix
	* The whole file must be end with a hash sign <kbd>#</kbd>  in the last line

	You could also classify your snippets with a title marked by 3 hashes <kbd>###</kbd>  in the first place

	**Attention** If there is a prompt information after dollar sign, the information should be joined together. Ex. <kbd>$1:solidLine</kbd> instead of <kbd>$1: solid line</kbd>

	```
	### object creation
	# create pitch object
	crPitch
	To Pitch: 0, 75, 600
	### graphics
	# set line form
	setLineForm
	$1:solidLine $0
	#
	```


2. Convert processing in command line
* Change the current working directory to your local project
* List your arguments of convert file name, input file name, editor option after "python"

	 So far, there are 4 editor options:

	 <kbd>-vsc</kbd> for Visual Studio Code,

	 <kbd>-sublime</kbd> for Sublime Text,

	 <kbd>-atom</kbd> for Atom,

	 <kbd>-all</kbd> for all these above, if you want.

	 For example:
	 ```
   $python snippetsConvertMasterV4.py snippetsPraat.txt -vsc
	 ```
	Then a text file for Vsc will be exported like below
	```
	{
	"create pitch object": {
		"prefix": "crPitch",
		"body": [
			"To Pitch: 0, 75, 600",
		],
		"description": "create pitch object"
	},
	"set line form": {
		"prefix": "setLineForm",
		"body": [
			"${1:solidLine} $0",
		],
		"description": "set line form"
	}
	}
	```
